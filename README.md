# Twitter Clone with React/Redux and TailwindCss

##### Note: I'm actively improving the project and adding new functionalities

**To run the project properly, follow the steps below:**

- Install dependencies by running `yarn install`
- Initialize the project by `yarn start`
- Run `json-server --watch db.json -p 3001<or whatever port you are using>` command to start json-server on another terminal
- Update `baseUrl` on `actions.js` same with your json server url (Generally "http://localhost:3001/")
